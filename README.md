This is the frontend part of the project [Where's Waldo](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app) from TOP.

For this project the flow decided to work with was:

1. Implement expected functionalities
2. Develop the frontend
3. As needed, add new functionalities

Also, I'll be following a somewhat TDD workflow.
"Somewhat" because the focus will be on integration tests instead of unit testing first.
For now I'll not be using tests for the frontend because I don't see value in them **(for lack of knowledge)** and as such I also do not know what would be a good implementation of them.

## Future features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modifiers ("not priority" and the like) don't imply importance. Most of the time they simply mean that I thought they were too difficult to tackle for now.

- Make High Score Modal WAI-ARIA compliant
